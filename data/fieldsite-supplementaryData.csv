Many Hadza delight in picking up an infant, speaking to it in repetitive and playful ways, rocking the baby or doing physical jokes and games that the infant likes -- for example bumping on a knee or giving exaggerated attentiveness to the infant. Singing goes along with this. Singing is also used in more serious cases to appease children whose crying doesn't respond to the usual appeasements of breast feeding, rocking, or fussing over. There are times in which children who are struggling (hunger, teething, other discomforts) are sung to throughout the night, by both mother and father. The singings seems to have a more meditative or even hypnotic quality in those cases. "

Tsimane use music to assist with traditional knowledge transmission. Musical performance includes instrumental music, traditional song, and improvisation. About 20% of adults 15-29 years old perform music but the proportion is higher (55%) among oldest adults (aged 60+ years). When traditional melodies are played on flutes or violins in the absence of lyrics, they may serve as surrogates for corresponding lyrical speech that listeners easily recognize. Traditional Tsimane songs provide pedagogical benefits; their lyrics reference important animals, plants, fish, and trees, and their delicate relationships with humans (and sometimes spirits). Tsimane often sing personal and melancholy improvisational songs to spouses and neighbors, disclosing candid details of love affairs, sexual
exploits, complaints, lamentations, and confessions. **End Schniter et al excerpt**

In the context of infant care specifically, both music and song are used relatively infrequently; when used their primary function is to soothe and encourage the infant to sleep."

Their primary work is daily wage agricultural labor and cultivation, with many involved in tobacco production. For subsistence, they rely on government provisions and often grow crops on small plots of land. Jenu Kurubas number around 30,000â€“35,000 members within the state of Karnataka. Our sample lived in two government-protected hamlets in the eastern section of Mysore district, with an estimated total population of 2,000.

In regards to infant care, bodily contact in early infancy is constant and lessens slightly during late infancy. Fathers are occasionally in close proximity to infants and mothers sometimes rely on relatives to assist with caregiving. Infant-directed song is common during infancy, but mothers often use additional means to soothe infants, such as rocking, and providing them with food, drink, or objects. Infants are gently weaned after one year of age. Ethnographic observations indicate that Jenu Kuruba infants one year and above are sometimes given drinks, such as coffee with milk and sugar, or juice, to assist with weaning.

But like all of Siberut, it is rapidly changing. The government village was built in the early 2010s and an Islamic development agency arrived soon afterwards. All of the parents recorded spend much of their time in the government village, and most, if not all, have traveled down to Muara Siberut, the port-town of Siberut Island. I'm confident that everyone has heard Bollywood music, partly because the songs (and Bollywood movies more generally) are popular throughout Mentawai and partly because there are two people in this village who have a speaker and a cell phone and blast it pretty often. 

The Mentawai phrase for singing a lullaby (at least in the Sarereiket region) is ""pasiboirok toga"", which means something like ""to make a child small"". Most of the parents sang a very similar song to put the baby to sleep. It's common for caretakers to sing a lullaby while the baby is suspended in a piece of cloth that hangs from the ceiling. The caretaker rocks the baby, much like a bassinet, while singing the soft song."

","Infant care: BaYaka infants are looked after by multiple caregivers. Allo-parenting is fundamental in childcare among the BaYaka with 77% of the proximate interactions with children under 4 years occurring with caregivers other than the mother (Chaudhary, 2017). The most important alloparents in the BaYaka are older siblings: cumulatively siblings provide over 30% of allocare for infants under 4 years (Chaudhary, 2017). BaYaka infants mainly learn by imitating and observing others until age of four, and once weaned, children spend most of their time in mixed-aged playgroups (Salali et al 2019). 
Music: Music is the fundamental part of the BaYaka culture and daily life. Women sing polyphonic songs during foraging trips to dispel dangerous animal. BaYaka rituals and initiations are marked by womenâ€™s polyphonic singing and drumming. Infants and children are almost always present in these foraging trips and rituals, being encouraged and praised if they attempt to participate in the musical performance (Lewis 2016).  BaYaka children begin their musical education in the womb as pregnant women engage in singing and dancing (Lewis 2016).
