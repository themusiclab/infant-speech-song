Attack Curve Slope,mir_attack,"Mean, Med, StD, Range, Min, Max, 1st Quart, 3rd Quart, IQR, Distance","MIRtoolbox detects acoustic events in the audio; for a subset of those it can compute an attack slope from amplitude curves, which is the slope of the line from the beginning of the event to its peak.","The slope of an attack curve provides a relative measure of ""alerting components,"" or immediately discriminable beginnings of a vocalization."
Roughness,mir_roughness,"Mean, Med, StD, Range, Max, 1st Quart, 3rd Quart, IQR, Distance","A roughness value produced by computing the peaks of the audio spectrum and taking the average of the dissonance between all possible pairs of peaks; following Buyens et al. (2017), we reduce this to a single measure by taking the RMS-normalized mean.","Along with inharmonicity, roughness provides one measure of dissonance in a recording. Roughness similarly provides at least one measure of vocal clarity."
85th Energy Percentile,mir_rolloff85,Whole,An estimate of the amount of high frequency in a signal measured by the frequency such that a 85% of the total energy is contained below it.,The 85th energy percentile allows a comparison of relative measures of high-frequency acoustics in a vocalization.
Inharmonicity,mir_inharmonicity,Whole,An estimate of the inharmonicity in the signal produced by identifying the number of partials that are not multiples of the fundamental frequency (i.e. those outside of the ideal harmonic range).,"Along with roughness, inharmonicity provides a more precise measure of dissonance in a vocalization."
Tempo,mir_tempo,Whole,A tempo estimate made by detecting periodicities from MIR's event detection curves. Outputs a single number.,Tempo allows assessment of the speed or pace of a vocalization.
Pule Clarity,mir_pulseclarity,Whole,"Estimates the rhythmic clarity, or strength of the beats (Lartillot et al. 2008).",Pulse clarity provides a measure of the vocal clarity of a speaker or emphasis on individual utterances.
nPVI Recording,npvi_total,Whole,"The nPVI equation measures the ``average degree of durational contrast between adjacent events in a sequence"" (Daniele & Patel, 2015). This makes it especially useful for comparing rhythmic units across language and music (i.e., syllables vs. notes). To automatically detect events, we used Mertens' (2004) syllable detection algorithm.","By providing a measure of durational contrast, nPVI_total is a measure of rhythmic complexity in a recording."
nPVI Phrase,npvi_phrase,Whole,"In addition to detecting syllables, Mertens' algorithm detects phrases. Whereas npvi_total computes nPVI based on the whole file as a continuous phrase, this measure computes the nPVI for each detected phrase and reports the mean. In other words, it excludes the distances between the ends and beginnings of phrases.","nPVI_phrase provides a more granular measure of rhythmic complexity, within phrases, rather than between them."
Temporal Modulation,tm_peak_hz,Whole,"The temporal modulation spectrum is the frequency decomposition of the amplitude envelope of a signal. This measures how loud something is at any given moment. We then measure how fast the loudness changes. For example: if someone sings a note every second, the spectrum will have a peak at 1Hz. If someone sings a note three times a second, but with an emphasis every three seconds, there will be a large peak at 1Hz, and a smaller peak at 3Hz. The peak of the spectrum is the frequency of the amplitude spectrum which has the highest root mean square of a given recording and represents a raw value of the recording's tempo.","The peak of the temporal modulation spectrum provides a measure of how maximally modulated, or variable, the onset of notes are in a recording, providing a raw measure of metre for speech and song."
Temporal Modulation,tm_std_hz,StD,"The temporal modulation spectrum is the frequency decomposition of the amplitude envelope of a signal. This measures how loud something is at any given moment. We then measure how fast the loudness changes. For example: if someone sings a note every second, the spectrum will have a peak at 1Hz. If someone sings a note three times a second, but with an emphasis every three seconds, there will be a large peak at 1Hz, and a smaller peak at 3Hz. The standard deviation of the spectrum is taken as a measure of how exaggerated the peak is.","The standard deviation of temporal modulation allows for an assessment of the overall variability of temporal modulations in a recording, providing a coarse measure of rhythm, with a lower standard deviation leaning towards more monorhythmic signals."
Pitch,praat_f0,"Mean, Med, StD, Range, Min, Max, 1st Quart, 3rd Quart, IQR",The fundamental frequency (f0) in Hertz for each recording,"Pitch provides a fundamental measure of the highness or lowness, in frequency, of an utterance. Likewise, the shape of the pitch curve and the overall value of pitch is a common discriminable feature in both speech and song."
Pitch Space,praat_f0travel,"Mean, Med, StD, Range, Max, 1st Quart, 3rd Quart, IQR",The distance between f0 at each .03125/sec interval to the next.,Pitch space provides a dynamic measure of pitch's range over time.
Pitch Rate,praat_pitch_rate,"Whole, Med, IQR","The pitch rate is a measure of pitch change over time. In essence, the pitch rate provides a measure of pitch curve smoothness (a lower value corresponds to a smoother curve).",The pitch rate provides a measure of how smooth or variable pitch is over time.
Vowel Space,praat_vowtrav,"Mean, Med, StD, Range, Max, 1st Quart, 3rd Quart, IQR",The Euclidian distance travelled in vowel space. This is equivalent to distance between the two formants.,Vowel space provides a measure of how much of the possible complex vowel space is used.

This is equivalent to distance between two formants divided by rate of time.,"Vowel travel rate provides a measure of how much of the vowel space is used over time, a relative measure of acoustic ""flashiness"" of a signal."
Amplitude,praat_intensity,"Mean, Med, StD, Range, Min, Max, 1st Quart, 3rd Quart, IQR, Distance",A measure of amplitude (loudness) in decibels,Amplitude provides a measure of how loud or quiet a vocalization is and can be compared between types within speakers

Amplitude Rate,praat_intensity_rate,"Whole, Med, IQR",A measure of decay in intensity curves in each recording measured as change in amplitude over time.,The intensity rate provides a measure of how loud or soft amplitude changes over time.
1st Formant,praat_f1,"Mean, Med, StD, Range, Min, Max, 1st Quart, 3rd Quart, IQR",The frequency in Hertz of the 1st formant at each (.03125/sec) point,1st formants are the 1st in a harmonic series following from the fundamental frequency and is important for a number of acoustic reasons.
